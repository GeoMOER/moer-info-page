The qualification goals of an MSc program correspond to level 7 of the German Qualification Framework for Lifelong Learning (DQR). According to this, the person must have "competences for working on new complex tasks and problems and for the independent control of processes in a scientific subject [...]. The requirement structure is characterised by frequent and unpredictable changes". (AK DQR 2011).
