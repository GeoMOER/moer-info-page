title: "Get prepared for SDM"
---


Slowly begin to get yourself familiar with some important references for the upcoming student presentations on different SDM techniques.

Start with the excellent overviews by Robert J. Hijmans and Jane Elith on [www.rspatial.org](https://www.rspatial.org/sdm/SDM.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
and by Damaris Zurell on [damariszurell.github.io](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/){:target="_blank"}.


Then continue with more specific literature like, e.g.
* [A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling speciesâ€™ distributions: what it does, and why inputs and settings matter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x){:target="_blank"},
* [A review of evidence about use and performance of species distribution modelling ensembles like BIOMOD](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12892){:target="_blank"},
* [Predicting species distribution: offering more than simple habitat models](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x){:target="_blank"}, or
* [Evolutionary algorithms for species distribution modelling: A review in the context of machine learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018304010){:target="_blank"}.
