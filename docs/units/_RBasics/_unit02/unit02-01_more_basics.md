title: "More basics"
---

Become familiar with basic operators, loop and decision structures, and code styling before focussing on reading and writing data, computing summary statistics, and visual data exploration.
Finally check the integrity of datasets and clean them up to ensure that the data basis for subsequent analyses is consistent.

## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* use logical and boolean operators to make decisions,
* use loops for repeated tasks,
* consider some basic code styling rules in your scripts,

* read and write tabulated data,
* compute some summary statistics, 
* use R's basic plot functionality to quickly visualize your data,

* identify some common problems in the structure of data frames,
* subset, merge, separate a data frame in order to clean it,
* feel comfortable with the usage of R.



## Control structures
Control structures are used to make decisions during runtime, i.e. while the code is executed. Such decisions can be 
* if something happens, do something; otherwise, do something else
* do something n times
* do something until something is happening
